            This bohemian paradise is more CÃ´te d'Azur than Grecian island. Spetses was hot in the '60s, when it hosted Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, and remains a swanky summer retreat for Athens' glitterati to this day, full of fancy hotels, mansions and yachts, and stylish boutiques. Aside from a handful of locally-owned cabs, the four-mile-long island has banned cars in town, giving it a refreshingly 19th-century vibe, with horse-drawn carriages being a common sight.
